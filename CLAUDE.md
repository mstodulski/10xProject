The Post-Accident Vehicle Inspection Management System is a web application designed for efficient scheduling and 
management of post-accident vehicle inspections. The system allows consultants to book inspection appointments for clients, 
while inspectors can view their schedules, eliminating the issue of overlapping visits.

## Project Overview

This project is a Symfony 7.3-based web application for managing 

**Key Technologies:**
- PHP 8.4+
- Symfony 7.3 (with Doctrine ORM 3.5)
- MySQL 8.x
- Webpack Encore for frontend asset compilation
- jQuery, Bootstrap 5, FullCalendar

## Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
# Run all unit tests
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run specific test suite
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Tests.php

# Run PHPUnit with memory limit
php -d memory_limit=-1 vendor/bin/phpunit

# Static analysis with Psalm
vendor/bin/psalm
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Run migrations
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

# Validate database schema
php bin/console doctrine:schema:validate

# Show schema changes (don't apply)
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql

# Generate migration from entity changes
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff

# Manually create migration
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:generate

```

### Frontend Build
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Generate routing files for frontend
php bin/console fos:js-routing:dump --format=json --target=public/js/fos_js_routes.json
# Compile JS translations
php bin/console bazinga:js-translation:dump public
# Production build
npm run build
```

### System Maintenance
```bash
# Clear cache
php bin/console cache:clear
``` 

## Architecture Overview

### Entity Structure

- **Entities** (`src/Entity/`): Doctrine ORM entities with attributes mapping

### Controllers & Forms

- **Controllers** (`src/Controller/`): Traditional Symfony controllers for web interface
- **Forms** (`src/Form/`): Symfony form types with filter types for search/filtering

### Services

Key services in `src/Service/`:
- **AppContextService**: Context management


### Frontend Structure

- **Webpack Encore** configuration in `webpack.config.js`
- Multiple entry points for different pages/features
- **FOSJsRoutingBundle**: Exposes Symfony routes to JavaScript
- **BazingaJsTranslationBundle**: Translation support in JavaScript
- Assets in `assets/` directory with organized JS files per feature

## Code Quality

- **Psalm**: Static analysis configured, ignoring Commands and DataFixtures
- **PHPUnit**: Configured test suites for entities, services, validators, types, etc.
- **Doctrine Validation**: Always validate schema after entity changes

## File Organization

- `src/Controller/`: Web controllers
- `src/Entity/`: Doctrine entities
- `src/EventListener/`: Symfony event listeners
- `src/Factory/`: Object factories
- `src/Form/`: Form types and filters
- `src/Repository/`: Doctrine repositories
- `src/Service/`: Business logic services
- `src/Validator/`: Custom validators
- `templates/`: Twig templates
- `translations/`: Translation files (organized by domain)
- `assets/`: Frontend assets (JS, CSS, images)
- `public/build/`: Compiled frontend assets (generated)
- `migrations/`: Database migrations

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
- Always use translations in messages and twig templates
- Always use subdirectories in the translations directory to create translation files for each controller.
- Always use subdirectories in the templates directory to create templates for individual controllers.
- In templates, always extend the /templates/base.html.twig template (except templates loaded by ajax).
